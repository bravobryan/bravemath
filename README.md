# bravemath
Personal side project of code functions in an attempt to solidify my understanding on the subjects related to math, statistics, physics, and chemistry.
Additionally, I'm putting into practice my Python Programming skills by creating different modules of code by creating Object classes and methods.

Over time I hope to create many projects that can help earn my way into a PhD in the field of Physics.
## Current challenges:

- Gaining enough knowledge to understand what I want to focus in PhD.
- Creating projects in Python and in other programs in an attempt to create physics simulations and adding it to my online portfolio.

- Eventually: Talk to a University on steps I can take and what more is needed to become a PhD student.
#### Code Visualizations:
Create a set of programs not constrained to Python, but eventually C++, etc... where I can create computational physics simulations.
- **In Progress**: Create a python plotting function that allows me to plot realnumbers represented in a line.
    - Needs to be updated to represent standard notations for intervals. Such as `(a, b) or (a, b] or [a, b]`.

### Potential Area of Focus:
This list is not absolute and I hope to reduce it to one area to focus. 
- Theory of Everything: String Theory/M-theory --- Potentially will be a side hobby / interest.
- Quantum Gravity
- Dark Matter and Dark Energy
- Particle Physics
- Environmental Physics

# Current Subjects of Personal Study:
- Calculus: Jon Rogawski
    - Precalculus Review
- Classical Mechanics: John R. Taylor
