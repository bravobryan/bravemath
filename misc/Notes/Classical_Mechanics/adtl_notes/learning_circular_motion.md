# ðŸ§­ Learning Circular Motion

#### 1. **Understanding the Position Vector**
To derive the position vector  
$$\vec{r}(t) = \hat{x} R \cos(\omega t) + \hat{y} R \sin(\omega t),$$  
you need to understand how circular motion is represented in Cartesian coordinates using trigonometric functions.

- ðŸ“¹ [8.2 Circular Motion: Position and Velocity Vectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9_Oe51XkVY) explains how to express position in terms of unit vectors and angular displacement. Itâ€™s especially helpful for visualizing the particle starting on the x-axis and rotating counter-clockwise.

- ðŸ“¹ [Uniform Circular Motion Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BwJ4rmNwzo) introduces angular velocity and how it relates to position over time, reinforcing the cosine and sine components.

#### 2. **Finding Velocity and Acceleration**
Take the time derivative of the position vector to get velocity, and then again for acceleration:
- Velocity:  
  $$\vec{v}(t) = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt} = -\hat{x} R \omega \sin(\omega t) + \hat{y} R \omega \cos(\omega t)$$  
- Acceleration:  
  $$\vec{a}(t) = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = -\hat{x} R \omega^2 \cos(\omega t) - \hat{y} R \omega^2 \sin(\omega t)$$

- ðŸ“¹ [Velocity and Acceleration for Circular Motion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKgknCnuQ3A) walks through how to compute these vectors and interpret their directions.

- ðŸ“¹ [Uniform Circular Motion and the acceleration vector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwAg-a0ziZQ) goes deeper into the math, showing how to take derivatives and proving that acceleration always points toward the center â€” a key property of centripetal acceleration.

---

#### 3. **Magnitude and Direction of Acceleration**
The magnitude of acceleration is  
$$|\vec{a}| = R \omega^2$$  
and it always points toward the center of the circle (centripetal direction).

- ðŸ“¹ [Uniform Circular Motion Formulas and Equations - College ...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IawY86XveQE) provides the key formulas for centripetal acceleration and force, helping you connect the math to physical intuition.

- ðŸ“¹ [Uniform Circular Motion: A Graphical Vector Understanding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUKft-lVA9s) uses vector diagrams to show how position, velocity, and acceleration relate visually â€” perfect for reinforcing your conceptual grasp.

### ðŸ§  Final Insights
This problem is a textbook example of **uniform circular motion**, where:
- Speed is constant
- Velocity changes direction continuously
- Acceleration is always inward (centripetal)
